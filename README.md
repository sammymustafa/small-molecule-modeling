# Modeling Small Molecules (6.8701)

This project explores how different neural network architectures can be used to analyze and model small molecules, showing how machine learning methods can be applied in bioinformatics.

## Key Highlights

### 1. Exploring Neural Network Architectures
* **Single- and Multi-Layer MLPs:** I began by working with single-layer and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to build a baseline understanding of their behavior in molecular modeling.

### 2. Working with Different Molecular Representations
* Morgan Fingerprints + MLPs: Used MLPs to model Morgan fingerprints, a way of encoding molecular structures, to capture structural features and chemical properties.  
* SMILES Strings + RNNs: Applied recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to SMILES strings, treating chemical structures as text sequences to link chemistry with natural language approaches.  
* Molecular Graphs + GNNs: Built models with graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent molecular graphs, allowing the capture of complex relationships between atoms and bonds.

### 3. Comparing Model Performance
* I compared the modelsâ€™ ability to predict molecular properties, noting the strengths and limitations of each approach and when one architecture may be more effective than another.

## Conclusion
This work shows how neural networks can be adapted for molecular modeling. Each method offers different advantages and, together, they highlight the value of tailoring machine learning techniques to the challenges of chemical and biological data.

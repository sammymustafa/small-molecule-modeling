# Modeling Small Molecules (6.8701)

Here, I demonstrate the application of various neural network architectures for the analysis and modeling of small molecules, showcasing the integration of machine learning techniques in bioinformatics.

## Key Highlights:

### 1. Exploration of Neural Network Architectures:
* One- and Multi-Layer MLP Networks: Initially, I focused on understanding and analyzing the behavior of single-layer and multi-layer Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). This foundational work set the stage for more complex applications in molecular modeling.

### 2. Modeling Different Molecular Representations:
* Morgan Fingerprints with MLP: I applied MLPs to model Morgan fingerprints, a method for encoding molecular structures. This approach allowed for a nuanced understanding of molecular features and properties.
* SMILES Strings with RNN: Utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), I worked with SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings, a textual representation of chemical structures. This was a step towards integrating chemistry with natural language processing techniques.
* Molecular Graphs with GNN: In a more advanced application, I employed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model molecular graphs. This approach effectively captured the complex interactions within a molecule, demonstrating the power of GNNs in representing non-Euclidean data.

### 3. Comparative Analysis of Model Performance:
* A critical aspect of this project was comparing the accuracy of these models in predicting molecular properties. This comparison not only highlighted the strengths and limitations of each neural network type but also provided insights into their suitability for various molecular datasets.

## Conclusion
This work illustrates the effective application of advanced neural network models to the field of molecular modeling. It underscores the importance of adapting and applying specialized machine learning techniques to handle the complexities inherent in chemical and biological data sets.
